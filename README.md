###### _Build, Release and Operate Containerized Applications on AWS._ 

![latest version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/aws/copilot-cli) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/aws/copilot-cli](https://badges.gitter.im/aws/copilot-cli.svg)](https://gitter.im/aws/copilot-cli?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

* **Documentation**: [https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/)

The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release and operate production-ready containerized applications
on AWS App Runner or Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.

Use Copilot to:
* Deploy production-ready, scalable services on AWS from a Dockerfile in one command.
* Add databases or inject secrets to your services.  
* Grow from one microservice to a collection of related microservices in an application.
* Set up test and production environments, across regions and accounts.
* Set up CI/CD pipelines to release your services to your environments.
* Monitor and debug your services from your terminal.

## Getting started

Make sure you have the AWS command line tool installed and have already run `aws configure` before you start.

To get a sample app up and running in one command, run the following:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:aws-samples/aws-copilot-sample-service.git demo-app
$ cd demo-app
$ copilot init --app demo                \
  --name api                             \
  --type 'Load Balanced Web Service'     \
  --dockerfile './Dockerfile'            \
  --deploy
```

This will create a VPC, Application Load Balancer, an Amazon ECS Service with the sample app running on AWS Fargate.
This process will take around 8 minutes to complete - at which point you'll get a URL for your sample app running! üöÄ
