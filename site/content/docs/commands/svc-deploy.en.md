## What does it do?

`copilot svc deploy` takes your local code and configuration and deploys it.

The steps involved in service deploy are:

1. Build your local Dockerfile into an image
2. Tag it with the value from `--tag` or the latest git sha (if you're in a git directory)
3. Push the image to ECR
4. Package your manifest file and addons into CloudFormation
4. Create / update your ECS task definition and service
