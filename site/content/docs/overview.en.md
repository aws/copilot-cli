Welcome to the AWS Copilot CLI ðŸŽ‰

The Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production-ready containerized applications on 
AWS App Runner and Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.
From getting started, pushing to staging, and releasing to production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.

## Installing

You can install AWS Copilot through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or by downloading the binaries directly. If you don't want to use Homebrew, you can install [manually](./getting-started/install.en.md). 

```sh
$ brew install aws/tap/copilot-cli
```
