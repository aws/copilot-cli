You can install AWS Copilot through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or by downloading the binaries directly.

## Homebrew üçª

```sh
brew install aws/tap/copilot-cli
```

??? info "Are you using Rosetta on a Mac machine with Apple silicon?"
    If your homebrew was installed with [Rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment), then the `brew install` will install the amd64 build. 
    If this is not what you want, please either reinstall homebrew without Rosetta, or use the manual installation option below.
