    If you specify a string, Copilot interprets it as the path exposed in your container to handle target group health check requests. The default is "/".
    ```yaml
    http:
      additional_rules:
        - healthcheck: '/'
    ```
    You can also specify healthcheck as a map:
    ```yaml
    http:
      additional_rules:
        - healthcheck:
            path: '/'
            port: 8080
            success_codes: '200'
            healthy_threshold: 3
            unhealthy_threshold: 2
            interval: 15s
            timeout: 10s
    ```

    The destination that the health check requests are sent to.
    
    <span class="parent-field">http.additional_rules.healthcheck.</span><a id="http-additional-rules-healthcheck-port" href="#http-additional-rules-healthcheck-port" class="field">`port`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>  
    The port that the health check requests are sent to. The default is [`image.port`](./#image-port), or the port exposed by [`http.target_container`](./#http-target-container), if set.  
    If the port exposed is `443`, then the health check protocol is automatically set to HTTPS.

    The HTTP status codes that healthy targets must use when responding to an HTTP health check. You can specify values between 200 and 499. You can specify multiple values (for example, "200,202") or a range of values (for example, "200-299"). The default is 200.
