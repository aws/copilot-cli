<a id="publish" href="#publish" class="field">`publish`</a> <span class="type">Map</span>  
The `publish` section allows services to publish messages to one or more SNS topics.

```yaml
publish:
  topics:
    - name: orderEvents
```

In the example above, this manifest declares an SNS topic named `orderEvents` that other worker services deployed to the Copilot environment can subscribe to. An environment variable named `COPILOT_SNS_TOPIC_ARNS` is injected into your workload as a JSON string.

In JavaScript, you could write:
```js
const {orderEvents} = JSON.parse(process.env.COPILOT_SNS_TOPIC_ARNS)
```
For more details, see the [pub/sub](../developing/publish-subscribe.en.md) page.
