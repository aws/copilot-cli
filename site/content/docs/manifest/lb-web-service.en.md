<a id="name" href="#name" class="field">`name`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
The name of your service.

<div class="separator"></div>

<a id="type" href="#type" class="field">`type`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
The architecture type for your service. A [Load Balanced Web Service](../concepts/services.en.md#load-balanced-web-service) is an internet-facing service that's behind a load balancer, orchestrated by Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.

{% include 'http-config.en.md' %}

{% include 'nlb.en.md' %}

{% include 'image-config-with-port.en.md' %}

{% include 'image-healthcheck.en.md' %}

{% include 'task-size.en.md' %}

{% include 'platform.en.md' %}

<div class="separator"></div>

<a id="count" href="#count" class="field">`count`</a> <span class="type">Integer or Map</span>  
If you specify a number:
```yaml
count: 5
```
The service will set the desired count to 5 and maintain 5 tasks in your service.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-spot" href="#count-spot" class="field">`spot`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>

If you want to use Fargate Spot capacity to run your services, you can specify a number under the `spot` subfield:
```yaml
count:
  spot: 5
```
!!! info
    Fargate Spot is not supported for containers running on ARM architecture.

<div class="separator"></div>

Alternatively, you can specify a map for setting up autoscaling:
```yaml
count:
  range: 1-10
  cpu_percentage: 70
  memory_percentage: 80
  requests: 10000
  response_time: 2s
```

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-range" href="#count-range" class="field">`range`</a> <span class="type">String or Map</span>  
You can specify a minimum and maximum bound for the number of tasks your service should maintain, based on the values you specify for the metrics.
```yaml
count:
  range: n-m
```
This will set up an Application Autoscaling Target with the `MinCapacity` of `n` and `MaxCapacity` of `m`.

Alternatively, if you wish to scale your service onto Fargate Spot instances, specify `min` and `max` under `range` and then specify `spot_from` with the desired count you wish to start placing your services onto Spot capacity. For example:

```yaml
count:
  range:
    min: 1
    max: 10
    spot_from: 3
```

This will set your range as 1-10 as above, but will place the first two copies of your service on dedicated Fargate capacity. If your service scales to 3 or higher, the third and any additional copies will be placed on Spot until the maximum is reached.

<span class="parent-field">range.</span><a id="count-range-min" href="#count-range-min" class="field">`min`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>  
The minimum desired count for your service using autoscaling.

<span class="parent-field">range.</span><a id="count-range-max" href="#count-range-max" class="field">`max`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>  
The maximum desired count for your service using autoscaling.

<span class="parent-field">range.</span><a id="count-range-spot-from" href="#count-range-spot-from" class="field">`spot_from`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>  
The desired count at which you wish to start placing your service using Fargate Spot capacity providers.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-cpu-percentage" href="#count-cpu-percentage" class="field">`cpu_percentage`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>  
Scale up or down based on the average CPU your service should maintain.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-memory-percentage" href="#count-memory-percentage" class="field">`memory_percentage`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>  
Scale up or down based on the average memory your service should maintain.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="requests" href="#count-requests" class="field">`requests`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>  
Scale up or down based on the request count handled per tasks.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="response-time" href="#count-response-time" class="field">`response_time`</a> <span class="type">Duration</span>  
Scale up or down based on the service average response time.
