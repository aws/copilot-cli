<a id="name" href="#name" class="field">`name`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
The name of your service.

<div class="separator"></div>

<a id="type" href="#type" class="field">`type`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
The architecture type for your service. A [Load Balanced Web Service](../concepts/services.en.md#load-balanced-web-service) is an internet-facing service that's behind a load balancer, orchestrated by Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate.

<div class="separator"></div>

<a id="http" href="#http" class="field">`http`</a> <span class="type">Boolean or Map</span>  
The http section contains parameters related to integrating your service with an Application Load Balancer.

To disable the Application Load Balancer, specify `http: false`. Note that for a Load-Balanced Web Service,
at least one of Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer must be enabled.

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-path" href="#http-path" class="field">`path`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
Requests to this path will be forwarded to your service. Each listener rule should listen on a unique path.

{% include 'http-healthcheck.en.md' %}

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-deregistration-delay" href="#http-deregistration-delay" class="field">`deregistration_delay`</a> <span class="type">Duration</span>  
The amount of time to wait for targets to drain connections during deregistration. The default is 60s. Setting this to a larger value gives targets more time to gracefully drain connections, but increases the time required for new deployments. Range 0s-3600s.

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-target-container" href="#http-target-container" class="field">`target_container`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
A sidecar container that requests are routed to instead of the main service container.  
If the target container's port is set to `443`, then the protocol is set to `HTTPS` so that the load balancer establishes 
TLS connections with the Fargate tasks using certificates that you install on the target container.

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-target-port" href="#http-target-port" class="field">`target_port`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
Optional. The container port that receives traffic. By default, this will be `image.port` if the target container is the main container, 
or `sidecars.<name>.port` if the target container is a sidecar.

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-stickiness" href="#http-stickiness" class="field">`stickiness`</a> <span class="type">Boolean</span>  
Indicates whether sticky sessions are enabled.

  allowed_source_ips: ["192.0.2.0/24", "198.51.100.10/32"]
```

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-alias" href="#http-alias" class="field">`alias`</a> <span class="type">String or Array of Strings or Array of Maps</span>  
HTTPS domain alias of your service.
```yaml
# String version.

# Alternatively, as an array of maps.
http:
  alias:
    - name: example.com
      hosted_zone: Z0873220N255IR3MTNR4
    - name: v1.example.com
      hosted_zone: AN0THE9H05TED20NEID
```
<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-hosted-zone" href="#http-hosted-zone" class="field">`hosted_zone`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
ID of your existing hosted zone; can only be used with `http.alias`. If you have an environment with imported certificates, you can specify the hosted zone into which Copilot should insert the A record once the load balancer is created.
```yaml
http:
  alias: example.com
  hosted_zone: Z0873220N255IR3MTNR4
# Also see http.alias array of maps example, above.
```
<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-redirect-to-https" href="#http-redirect-to-https" class="field">`redirect_to_https`</a> <span class="type">Boolean</span>  
Automatically redirect the Application Load Balancer from HTTP to HTTPS. By default it is `true`.

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-version" href="#http-version" class="field">`version`</a> <span class="type">String</span>  
The HTTP(S) protocol version. Must be one of `'grpc'`, `'http1'`, or `'http2'`. If omitted, then `'http1'` is assumed.
If using gRPC, please note that a domain must be associated with your application.

<span class="parent-field">http.</span><a id="http-additional-rules" href="#http-additional-rules" class="field">`additional_rules`</a> <span class="type">Array of Maps</span>  
Configure multiple ALB listener rules.

{% include 'http-additionalrules.en.md' %}

{% include 'nlb.en.md' %}

{% include 'image-config-with-port.en.md' %}  
If the port is set to `443`, then the protocol is set to `HTTPS` so that the load balancer establishes
TLS connections with the Fargate tasks using certificates that you install on the container.

{% include 'image-healthcheck.en.md' %}

{% include 'task-size.en.md' %}

{% include 'platform.en.md' %}

<div class="separator"></div>

<a id="count" href="#count" class="field">`count`</a> <span class="type">Integer or Map</span>
The number of tasks that your service should maintain.

If you specify a number:
```yaml
count: 5
```
The service will set the desired count to 5 and maintain 5 tasks in your service.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-spot" href="#count-spot" class="field">`spot`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>

If you want to use Fargate Spot capacity to run your services, you can specify a number under the `spot` subfield:
```yaml
count:
  spot: 5
```
!!! info
    Fargate Spot is not supported for containers running on ARM architecture.

<div class="separator"></div>

Alternatively, you can specify a map for setting up autoscaling:
```yaml
count:
  range: 1-10
  cooldown:
    in: 30s
    out: 60s
  cpu_percentage: 70
  memory_percentage:
    value: 80
    cooldown:
      in: 80s
      out: 160s
  requests: 10000
  response_time: 2s
```

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-range" href="#count-range" class="field">`range`</a> <span class="type">String or Map</span>  
You can specify a minimum and maximum bound for the number of tasks your service should maintain, based on the values you specify for the metrics.
```yaml
count:
  range: n-m
```
This will set up an Application Autoscaling Target with the `MinCapacity` of `n` and `MaxCapacity` of `m`.

Alternatively, if you wish to scale your service onto Fargate Spot instances, specify `min` and `max` under `range` and then specify `spot_from` with the desired count you wish to start placing your services onto Spot capacity. For example:

```yaml
count:
  range:
    min: 1
    max: 10
    spot_from: 3
```

This will set your range as 1-10 as above, but will place the first two copies of your service on dedicated Fargate capacity. If your service scales to 3 or higher, the third and any additional copies will be placed on Spot until the maximum is reached.

<span class="parent-field">count.range.</span><a id="count-range-min" href="#count-range-min" class="field">`min`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>
The minimum desired count for your service using autoscaling.

<span class="parent-field">count.range.</span><a id="count-range-max" href="#count-range-max" class="field">`max`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>
The maximum desired count for your service using autoscaling.

<span class="parent-field">count.range.</span><a id="count-range-spot-from" href="#count-range-spot-from" class="field">`spot_from`</a> <span class="type">Integer</span>
The desired count at which you wish to start placing your service using Fargate Spot capacity providers.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-cooldown" href="#count-cooldown" class="field">`cooldown`</a> <span class="type">Map</span>
Cooldown scaling fields that are used as the default cooldown for all autoscaling fields specified.

<span class="parent-field">count.cooldown.</span><a id="count-cooldown-in" href="#count-cooldown-in" class="field">`in`</a> <span class="type">Duration</span>
The cooldown time for autoscaling fields to scale up the service.

<span class="parent-field">count.cooldown.</span><a id="count-cooldown-out" href="#count-cooldown-out" class="field">`out`</a> <span class="type">Duration</span>
The cooldown time for autoscaling fields to scale down the service.

The following options `cpu_percentage`, `memory_percentage`, `requests` and `response_time` are autoscaling fields for `count` which can be defined either as the value of the field, or as a Map containing advanced information about the field's `value` and `cooldown`:
```yaml
value: 50
cooldown:
  in: 30s
  out: 60s
```
The cooldown specified here will override the default cooldown.

<span class="parent-field">count.</span><a id="count-cpu-percentage" href="#count-cpu-percentage" class="field">`cpu_percentage`</a> <span class="type">Integer or Map</span>
Scale up or down based on the average CPU your service should maintain.
