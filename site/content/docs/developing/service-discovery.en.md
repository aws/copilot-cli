# Service Discovery

Service Discovery is a way of letting services discover and connect with each other. Typically, services can only talk to each other if they expose a public endpoint - and even then, requests will have to go over the internet. With [ECS Service Discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/service-discovery.html), each service you create is given a private address and DNS name - meaning each service can talk to another without ever leaving the local network (VPC) and without exposing a public endpoint.  

## How do I use Service Discovery?

Service Discovery is enabled for all services set up using the Copilot CLI. We'll show you how to use it by using an example. Imagine we have an app called `kudos` and two services: `api` and `front-end`. 

!!! Attention
    Service Discovery is not supported for Request-Driven Web Services.

In this example we'll imagine our `front-end` service is deployed in the `test` environment, has a public endpoint and wants to call our `api` service using its service discovery endpoint. 

```go
// Calling our api service from the front-end service using Service Discovery
func ServiceDiscoveryGet(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, ps httprouter.Params) {
    endpoint := fmt.Sprintf("http://api.%s/some-request", os.Getenv("COPILOT_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT"))
    resp, err := http.Get(endpoint /* http://api.test.kudos.local/some-request */)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()
    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    w.Write(body)
}
```

The important part is that our `front-end` service is making a request to our `api` service through a special endpoint:

```go
endpoint := fmt.Sprintf("http://api.%s/some-request", os.Getenv("COPILOT_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT"))
```

`COPILOT_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT` is a special environment variable that the Copilot CLI sets for you when it creates your service. It's of the format _{env name}.{app name}.local_ - so in this case in our _kudos_ app, when deployed in the _test_ environment, the request would be to `http://api.test.kudos.local/some-request`. Since our _api_ service is running on port 80, we're not specifying the port in the URL. However, if it was running on another port, say 8080, we'd need to include the port in the request, as well `http://api.kudos.local:8080/some-request`.

When our front-end makes this request, the endpoint `api.test.kudos.local` resolves to a private IP address and is routed privately within your VPC. 

## Legacy Environments and Service Discovery

Prior to Copilot v1.9.0, the service discovery namespace used the format _{app name}.local_, without including the environment. This limitation made it impossible to deploy multiple environments in the same VPC. Any environments created with Copilot v1.9.0 and newer can share a VPC with any other environment.

When your environments are upgraded, Copilot will honor the service discovery namespace that the environment was created with. That means that the endpoint your services are reachable at will not change. Any new environments created with Copilot v1.9.0 and above will use the _{env name}.{app name}.local_ format for service discovery, and can share VPCs with older environments.
