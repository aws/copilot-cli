# 'AWS Copilot v1.32: `run local --proxy`, `run local --watch`, imported ALB support

Posted On: November 9, 2023

The AWS Copilot core team is announcing the Copilot v1.32 release.

Our public [—Åommunity —Åhat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#aws_copilot-cli:gitter.im) has over 500 people participating, and our GitHub repository has over 3,100 stars on [GitHub](http://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/) üöÄ.
Thanks to every one of you who shows love and support for AWS Copilot.

Copilot v1.32 brings big enhancements to help you develop more flexibly and efficiently:

- **`copilot run local --proxy`**:
- **`copilot run local --watch`**:
- **Importing ALBs**: You can front your Load-Balanced Web Services with existing ALBs. [See detailed section](#imported-ALBs)

???+ note "What‚Äôs AWS Copilot?"

    The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production-ready applications on AWS.
    From getting started, pushing to staging, and releasing to production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.
    At the foundation of Copilot is AWS CloudFormation, which enables you to provision Infrastructure as Code.
    Copilot provides pre-defined CloudFormation templates and user-friendly workflows for different types of microservice architectures,
    enabling you to focus on developing your application, instead of writing deployment scripts.

    See the section [Overview](../docs/concepts/overview.en.md) for a more detailed introduction to AWS Copilot.

## Imported ALBs

Copilot now supports the new field `http.alb` in the [Load-Balanced Web Service manifest](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md). Rather than letting Copilot create a new Application Load Balancer in your environment to be shared among all load-balanced services, you may designate an existing public-facing ALB for a specific Load-Balanced Web Service (LBWS). Specify the ARN or name of an ALB from your VPC in your LBWS manifest:

```yaml
http:
  alb: [name or ARN]
```
For imported ALBs, Copilot does not manage DNS-related resources like certificates.
