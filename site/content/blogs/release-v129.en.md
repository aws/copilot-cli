# AWS Copilot v1.29: Pipeline template overrides and CloudFront cache invalidation!

Posted On: July 18, 2023

The AWS Copilot core team is announcing the Copilot v1.29 release.

Special thanks to [@tjhorner](https://github.com/tjhorner) and [@build-with-aws-copilot](https://github.com/build-with-aws-copilot), who contributed to this <release class=""></release>
Our public [сommunity сhat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#aws_copilot-cli:gitter.im) is growing and has nearly 500 people online and over 2.9k stars on [GitHub](http://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/).
Thanks to every one of you who shows love and support for AWS Copilot.

Copilot v1.29 brings big enhancements to help you develop more flexibly and efficiently:

- **Pipeline overrides**: In [v1.27.0](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/blogs/release-v127/#extend-copilot-generated-aws-cloudformation-templates), we introduced CDK and yaml patch overrides for workload and environment CloudFormation templates. Now you can enjoy the same extensibility for Copilot pipeline templates! [See detailed section](#pipeline-overrides).
- **Static Site enhancements**: We've improved our [latest workload type](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/blogs/release-v128/#static-site-service-type) with CloudFront cache invalidation and Static Site-tailored operational commands. [See detailed section](#static-site-enhancements).

???+ note "What’s AWS Copilot?"

The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production ready containerized applications on AWS.
From getting started, pushing to staging, and releasing to production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.
At the foundation of Copilot is AWS CloudFormation, which enables you to provision infrastructure as code.
Copilot provides pre-defined CloudFormation templates and user-friendly workflows for different types of micro service architectures,
enabling you to focus on developing your application, instead of writing deployment scripts.

See the section [Overview](../docs/concepts/overview.en.md) for a more detailed introduction to AWS Copilot.
