# AWS Copilot v1.27: Extend Copilot templates, additional routing rule supports, preview differences, and sidecar improvements!
##### Posted On: Mar 28, 2023

The AWS Copilot core team is announcing the Copilot v1.27 release üöÄ.  
Our public [—Åommunity —Åhat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#aws_copilot-cli:gitter.im) is growing and has over 400 people online and over 2.7k stars on [GitHub](http://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/).
Thanks to every one of you who shows love and support for AWS Copilot.

Copilot v1.27 is a big release with several new features and improvements:

- **Extend Copilot templates**: You can now customize any properties in Copilot-generated AWS CloudFormation templates 
with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) or YAML Patch overrides. [See detailed section](#extend-copilot-generated-aws-cloudformation-templates).
- **Enable multiple listeners and listener rules**: You can define multiple host-based or path listener rules for [application load balancers](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md#http)
or multiple listeners on different ports and protocols for [network load balancers](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md#nlb).  
  [See detailed section](#enable-multiple-listeners-and-listener-rules-for-load-balancers).
- **Preview CloudFormation template changes**: You can now run `copilot [noun] package` or `copilot [noun] deploy` commands with the `--diff` flag to show differences
  between the last deployed CloudFormation template and local changes. [See detailed section](#preview-aws-cloudformation-template-changes).
- **Build and push container images for sidecars**: Add support for `image.build` to build and push sidecar containers from local Dockerfiles. [See detailed section](#build-and-push-container-images-for-sidecar-containers).
- **Environment file support for sidecars**: Add support for `env_file` to push a local `.env` file for sidecar containers. [See detailed section](#upload-local-environment-files-for-sidecar-containers).

??? note "What‚Äôs AWS Copilot?"

    The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production-ready containerized applications on AWS.
    From getting started to releasing in production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.
    At the foundation of Copilot is AWS CloudFormation, which enables you to provision infrastructure as code.
    Copilot provides pre-defined CloudFormation templates and user-friendly workflows for different types of microservice architectures,
    enabling you to focus on developing your application instead of writing deployment scripts.

    See the [Overview](../docs/concepts/overview.en.md) section for a more detailed introduction to AWS Copilot.

## Extend Copilot-generated AWS CloudFormation templates

#### Preview AWS CloudFormation template changes

##### `copilot [noun] package --diff`

You can now run `copilot [noun] package --diff` to see the diff between your local changes and the latest deployed template. 
The program will exit after it prints the diff. 

!!! info "The exit codes when using `copilot [noun] package --diff`"
    0 = no diffs found  
    1 = diffs found  
    2 = error producing diffs


```console
$ copilot env deploy --diff
~ Resources:
    ~ Cluster:
        ~ Properties:
            ~ ClusterSettings:
                ~ - (changed item)
                  ~ Value: enabled -> disabled
```

If the diff looks good to you, you can run `copilot [noun] package` again to write the template file and parameter file
to your designated directory.


##### `copilot [noun] deploy --diff`

Similar to `copilot [noun] package --diff`, you can run `copilot [noun] deploy --diff` to see the same diff. 
However, instead of exiting after it print the diff, Copilot will follow up with a question: `Continue with the deployment? [y/N]`.

```console
$ copilot job deploy --diff
~ Resources:
    ~ TaskDefinition:
        ~ Properties:
            ~ ContainerDefinitions:
                ~ - (changed item)
                  ~ Environment:
                      (4 unchanged items)
                      + - Name: LOG_LEVEL
                      +   Value: "info"

Continue with the deployment? (y/N)
```

If the diff looks good to you, enter "y" to deploy. Otherwise, enter "N" to make adjustments as needed!


## Enable multiple listeners and listener rules for Load Balancers
You can now configure additional listener rules for Application Load Balancer as well as additional listeners for 
Network Load Balancer.

### Add multiple host-based or path-based listener rules to your Application Load Balancer
You can configure additional listener rules for ALB with the new field [`http.additional_rules`](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md#http-additional-rules). 
Let's learn through an example. 

Say we want to expand the basic manifest such that it handles more traffic on port 8081 of the main service container, and 8082 on the sidecar container, in addition to the existing `image.port` 8080.
```yaml
name: 'frontend'
type: 'Load Balanced Web Service'
 
image:
  build: Dockerfile
  port: 8080
  
http:
  path: '/'
  additional_rules:            # The new field "additional_rules".
    - path: 'customerdb'  
      target_port: 8081        # Optional. Defaults to the `image.port`.
    - path: 'admin'
      target_container: nginx   # Optional. Defaults to the main container. 
      target_port: 8082
    - path: 'superAdmin'   
      target_port: 80

sidecars:
  nginx:
    port: 80
    image: public.ecr.aws/nginx:latest
```
With this manifest, requests to ‚Äú/‚Äù will be routed to the main container on port 8080. Requests to "/customerdb" will be routed to the main container on port 8081, 
, "/admin" to nginx on port 8082 and "/superAdmin" to nginx on port 80. Note that the third listener rule just defined 'target_port: 80' 
and Copilot was able to intelligently route traffic from the '/superAdmin' to the nginx sidecar container.

It is also possible to configure the container port that handles the requests to ‚Äú/‚Äù via the new field [`http.target_port`](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md#http-target-port)

### Add multiple port and protocol listeners to your Network Load Balancers
You can configure additional listeners for NLB with the new field [`nlb.additional_listeners`](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md#nlb-additional-listeners).
Let's learn through an example.

```yaml
name: 'frontend'
type: 'Load Balanced Web Service'

image:
  build: Dockerfile

http: false
nlb:
  port: 8080/tcp
  additional_listeners:
    - port: 8081/tcp
    - port: 8082/tcp
      target_port: 8085               # Optional. Default is set 8082.
      target_container: nginx         # Optional. Default is set to the main container.

sidecars:
  nginx:
    port: 80
    image: public.ecr.aws/nginx:latest
```
With this manifest, requests to NLB port 8080 will be routed to the main container‚Äôs port 8080. 
Requests to the NLB on port 8081 will be routed to the port 8081 of the main container. 
We need to notice here that the default value of the target_port will be the same as that of the corresponding NLB port. 
The requests to NLB port 8082 will be routed to port 8085 of the sidecar container named nginx.

## Sidecar improvements

### Build and push container images for sidecar containers

### Upload local environment files for sidecar containers
You can now specify an environment file to upload to any sidecar container in your task.
Previously, you could only specify an environment file for your main task container: 

```yaml
# in copilot/{service name}/manifest.yml
env_file: log.env
```

Now, you can do the same in a sidecar definition:
```yaml
sidecars:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    env_file: ./nginx.env
    port: 8080
```

It also works with the managed `logging` sidecar:

```yaml
logging:
  retention: 1
  destination:
    Name: cloudwatch
    region: us-west-2
    log_group_name: /copilot/logs/
    log_stream_prefix: copilot/
  env_file: ./logging.env
```

If you specify the same file more than once in different sidecars, Copilot will only upload the file to S3 once.
