???+ note "What’s AWS Copilot?"

    The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production ready containerized applications on AWS.
    From getting started, pushing to staging, and releasing to production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.
    At the foundation of Copilot is AWS CloudFormation, which enables you to provision infrastructure as code.
    Copilot provides pre-defined CloudFormation templates and user-friendly workflows for different types of micro service architectures,
    enabling you to focus on developing your application, instead of writing deployment scripts.

    See the section [Overview](../docs/concepts/overview.en.md) for a more detailed introduction to AWS Copilot.
