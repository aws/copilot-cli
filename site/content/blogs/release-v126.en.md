# AWS Copilot v1.26: Automate rollbacks with CloudWatch alarms, build sidecar images, and `storage init` for env addons

Posted On: Feb 20, 2023

The AWS Copilot core team is announcing the Copilot v1.26 release.  
Our public [сommunity сhat](https://gitter.im/aws/copilot-cli) is growing and has over 400 people online and over 2.6k stars on [GitHub](http://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/).
Thanks to every one of you who shows love and support for AWS Copilot.

Copilot v1.26 brings several new features and improvements:

- **Service alarm-based rollback**: [See detailed section](#service-alarm-based-rollback).
- **`storage init` for environment addons**: [See detailed section](#storage-init-for-environment-addons).
- **Sidecar image build**: [See detailed section](#sidecar-image-build).
- **Request-Driven Web Service secrets support**: [See detailed section](#request-driven-web-service-secrets-support).

???+ note "What’s AWS Copilot?"

    The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production-ready containerized applications on AWS.
    From getting started to releasing in production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.
    At the foundation of Copilot is AWS CloudFormation, which enables you to provision infrastructure as code.
    Copilot provides pre-defined CloudFormation templates and user-friendly workflows for different types of microservice architectures,
    enabling you to focus on developing your application instead of writing deployment scripts.

    See the [Overview](../docs/concepts/overview.en.md) section for a more detailed introduction to AWS Copilot.

## Service alarm-based rollback
You can now [monitor your ECS deployments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/automate-rollbacks-for-amazon-ecs-rolling-deployments-with-cloudwatch-alarms/) with custom [CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/deployment-alarm-failure.html)! Configure your services to roll back to the last completed deployment if your alarms go into `In alarm` state during deployment. With the [circuit breaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-circuit-breaker.html), Copilot has already been rolling back your failed deployments. Now, you can also roll back service deployments that aren't failing, but aren't performing in accordance with the metrics of your choice.

In your backend, worker, or load-balanced web service manifest, you may import your own existing CloudWatch alarms:
    ```yaml
    deployment:
      rollback_alarms: ["MyAlarm-ELB-4xx", "MyAlarm-ELB-5xx"]
    ```

Or have Copilot create a CPU and/or memory utilization alarm for you, with thresholds of your choice:
    ```yaml
    deployment:
      rollback_alarms:
        cpu_utilization: 70    // Percentage value at or above which alarm is triggered.
        memory_utilization: 50 // Percentage value at or above which alarm is triggered.
    ```

For worker services, you may also create an alarm to monitor `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed`:
    ```yaml
    deployment:
      rollback_alarms:
        messages_delayed: 5
    ```

 When Copilot creates alarms for you, some defaults are set under the hood:
    ```yaml
    ComparisonOperator: 'GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold'
    DatapointsToAlarm: 2
    EvaluationPeriods: 3
    Period: 60
    Statistic: 'Average'
    ```
With rollback alarms configured in your service manifest, each time you run `svc deploy` after the initial deployment (when there is no existing deployment to roll back to), ECS will poll your alarms and trigger a rollback if there is a breach. 

## `storage init` for environment addons

## Sidecar image build

## Request-Driven Web Service secrets support
You can now add your secrets (from SSM Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager) to your App Runner service as environment variables using Copilot. 

Similar to other service types such as Load-Balanced Web Service, you need to first add the following tags to your secrets:
| Key                     | Value                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `copilot-application`   | Application name from which you want to access the secret   |
| `copilot-environment`   | Environment name from which you want to access the secret   |

Then simply update your Request-Driven Web Service manifest with:
```yaml
  secrets:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: GH_TOKEN_SECRET
```
And deploy! Your service can now access the secret as an environment variable.

For more detailed use of the `secrets` field:
```yaml
secrets:
  # To inject a secret from SecretsManager.
  # (Recommended) Option 1. Referring to the secret by name.
  DB:
    secretsmanager: 'demo/test/mysql'
  # You can refer to a specific key in the JSON blob.
  DB_PASSWORD:
    secretsmanager: 'demo/test/mysql:password::'
  # You can substitute predefined environment variables to keep your manifest succinct.
  DB_PASSWORD:
        secretsmanager: '${COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME}/${COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}/mysql:password::'

  # Option 2. Alternatively, you can refer to the secret by ARN.
  DB: 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:111122223333:secret:demo/test/mysql-Yi6mvL'
 
  # To inject a secret from SSM Parameter Store
  # Option 1. Referring to the secret by ARN.
  GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET: 'arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:615525334900:parameter/GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET'

  # Option 2. Referring to the secret by name.
  GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET: GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```
See the [manifest specification](../../docs/manifest/rd-web-service/#secrets). To learn more about injecting secrets into your services, see [the secrets page](../../docs/developing/secrets.en.md)
