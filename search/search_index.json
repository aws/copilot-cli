Application credentials Copilot uses the AWS credentials from the default credential provider chain to store and look up your application's metadata : which services and environments belong to it. Tip We recommend using a named profile to store your application's credentials. The most convenient way is having the [default] profile point to your application's credentials: # ~/.aws/credentials [default] aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY # ~/.aws/config [default] region = us-west-2 Alternatively, you can set the AWS_PROFILE environment variable to point to a different named profile. For example, we can have a [my-app] profile that can be used for your Copilot application instead of the [default] profile. # ~/.aws/config [my-app] credential_process = /opt/bin/awscreds-custom --username helen region = us-west-2 # Then you can run your Copilot commands leveraging the alternative profile: $ export AWS_PROFILE = my-app $ copilot deploy Caution We do not recommend using the environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID , AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY , AWS_SESSION_TOKEN directly to look up your application's metadata because if they're overridden or expired, Copilot will not be able to look up your services or environments. To learn more about all the supported config file settings: Configuration and credential file settings . Environment credentials Copilot environments can be created in AWS accounts and regions separate from your application's. While initializing an environment, Copilot will prompt you to enter temporary credentials or a named profile to create your environment: $ copilot env init Name: prod-iad Which credentials would you like to use to create prod-iad? > Enter temporary credentials > [ profile default ] > [ profile test ] > [ profile prod-iad ] > [ profile prod-pdx ] Unlike the Application credentials , the AWS credentials for an environment are only needed for creation or deletion.

Copilot writes a Cloudformation template specifying the S3 bucket or DDB table to the addons dir. When you run copilot svc deploy , the CLI merges this template with all the other templates in the addons directory to create a nested stack associated with your service. This nested stack describes all the additional resources you've associated with that service and is deployed wherever your service is deployed. This means that after running $ copilot storage init -n bucket -t S3 -w fe $ copilot svc deploy -n fe -e test $ copilot svc deploy -n fe -e prod there will be two buckets deployed, one in the \"test\" env and one in the \"prod\" env, accessible only to the \"fe\" service in its respective environment.","title":"storage init"},{"location":"docs/commands/storage-init/#storage-init","text":"$ copilot storage init","title":"storage init"},{"location":"docs/commands/storage-init/#what-does-it-do","text":"copilot storage init creates a new storage resource attached to one of your services, accessible from inside your service container via a friendly environment variable.

Whether you have one service that does everything or a constellation of micro-services, Copilot organizes them and the environments they're deployed to into an \"application\". Let's walk through an example. We want to build a voting app which needs to collect votes and aggregate the results. To set up our vote app with two services, we can run copilot init twice. The first time we run copilot init , we'll be asked what we should call the application this service will belong to. Since we're trying to build a voting system, we can call our application \"vote\" and our first service \"collector\". The next time we run init , we'll be asked if we want to add our new service to the existing \u201cvote\u201d app, and we\u2019ll name the new service \"aggregator\". Your application configuration (which services and environments belong to it) is stored in your AWS account, so any other users in your account will be able to develop on the \u201cvote\" app as well. This means that you can have a teammate work on one service while you develop the other. Creating an App To set up an application, you can just run copilot init . You'll be asked if you want to set up an app or choose an use app. copilot init Once you've created an application, Copilot stores that application in SSM Parameter store in your AWS account. The account used to set up your application is known as the \"application account\". This is where your app's configuration lives, and anyone who has access to this account can use this app. All resources created within this application will be tagged with the copilot-app aws resource tag . This helps you know which app resources in your account belong to. The name of your application has to be unique within your account (even across region). Additional App Configurations You can also provide more granular configuration for your application by running copilot app init . This includes options to: Tag all application, service and environment resources with an additional set of aws resource tags Use a custom domain name for Load Balanced services $ copilot app init \\ --domain my-awesome-app.aws \\ --resource-tags department = MyDept,team = MyTeam App Infrastructure While the bulk of the infrastructure Copilot provisions is specific to an environment and service, there are some application-wide resources as well. ECR Repositories ECR Repositories are regional resources which store your service images. Each service has its own ECR Repository per region in your app. In the above diagram, the app has several environments spread across three regions. Each of those regions has its own ECR repository for every service in your app. In this case, there are three services. Every time you add a service, we create an ECR Repository in every region. We do this to maintain region isolation (if one region goes down, environments in other region won't be affected) and to reduce cross-region data transfer costs. These ECR Repositories all live within your app's account (not the environment accounts) - and have policies which allow your environment accounts to pull from them. Release Infrastructure For every region represented in your app, we create a KMS Key and an S3 bucket. These resources are used by CodePipeline to enable cross-region and cross-account deployments. All pipelines in your app share these same resources. Similar to the ECR Repositories, the S3 bucket and KMS keys have policies which allow for all of your environments, even in other accounts, to read encrypted deployment artifacts. This makes your cross-account, cross-region CodePipelines possible. Digging into your App Now that we've set up an app, we can check on it using Copilot. Below are a few common ways to check in on your app. What applications are in my account? To see all the apps in your current account and region you can run copilot app ls . $ copilot app ls vote ecs-kudos What's in my application? Running copilot app show will show you a summary of your application, including all the services and environments in your app. $ copilot app show About Name vote URI vote-app.aws Environments Name AccountID Region test 000000000000 us-east-1 Services Name Type collector Load Balanced Web Service aggregator Backend Service","title":"Applications"},{"location":"docs/concepts/applications/#creating-an-app","text":"To set up an application, you can just run copilot init .

This test environment contains all the AWS resources to provision a secure network (VPC, subnets, security groups, and more), as well as other resources that are meant to be shared between multiple services like an Application Load Balancer or an ECS Cluster. When you deploy your service into your test environment, your service will use the test environment's network and resources. Your application can have multiple environments, and each will have its own networking and shared resources infrastructure. While Copilot creates a test environment for you when you get started, it's common to create a new, separate environment for production. This production environment will be completely independent from the test environment, with its own networking stack and its own copy of services. By having both a test environment and a production environment, you can deploy changes to your test environment, validate them, then promote them to the production environment. In the diagram below we have an application called MyApp with two services, API and Backend . Those two services are deployed to the two environments, test and prod . You can see that in the test environment, both services are running only one container while the prod services have more containers running. Services can use different configurations depending on the environment they're deployed in. For more, check out the using environment variables guide. Creating an Environment To create a new environment in your app, you can run copilot env init from within your workspace. Copilot will ask you what you want to name this environment and what profile you'd like to use to bootstrap the environment. These profiles are AWS named profiles which are associated with a particular account and region. When you select one of these profiles, your environment will be created in whichever account and region that profile is associated with. $ copilot env init After you run copilot env init you can watch as Copilot sets up all the environment resources, which can take a few minutes. Once all those resources are created, the environment will be linked back to the application account. This allows actors in the application account to manage the environment, even without access to the environment account. This linking process also creates and configures new regional ECR repositories, if necessary. Deploying a Service When you first create a new environment, no services are deployed to it. To deploy a service run copilot deploy from that service's directory, and you'll be prompted to select which environment to deploy to. Environment Infrastructure VPC and Networking Each environment gets its own multi-AZ VPC. Your VPC is the network boundary of your environment, allowing the traffic you expect in and out, and blocking the rest. The VPCs Copilot creates are spread across two availability zones to help balance availability and cost - with each AZ getting a public and private subnet. Your services are launched in the public subnets but can be reached only through your load balancer. Load Balancers and DNS If you set up any service using one of the Load Balanced Service types, Copilot will set up an Application Load Balancer. All Load Balanced Web Services within an environment will share a load balancer by creating app-specific listeners on it. Your load balancer is allowed to communicate with services in your VPC. Optionally, when you set up an application, you can provide a domain name that you own and is registered in Route 53. If you provide a domain name, each time you spin up an environment, Copilot will create a subdomain environment-name.app-name.your-domain.com, provision an ACM cert, and bind it to your Application Load Balancer so it can use HTTPS. Customize your Environment Optionally, you can customize your environment interactively by using flags to import your existing resources, or configure the default environment resources. Currently, only VPC resources are customizable. However, if you want to customize more types of resources, feel free to bring your use cases and cut an issue! Digging into your Environment Now that we've spun up an environment, we can check on it using Copilot. Below are a few common ways to check in on your environment. What environments are part of my app? To see all the environments in your application you can run copilot env ls . $ copilot env ls test production What's in your environment? Running copilot env show will show you a summary of your environment. Here's an example of the output you might see for our test environment.

What happens when you want to have one copy of your service running only for testing and another copy serving production traffic? What happens when you want to add another service? How do you manage deploying to all of these services? Copilot wants to help you with all of these things so let's jump into some of Copilot's core concepts to understand how they can help. Applications An Application is a collection of services and environments. When you get started with Copilot, the first thing you'll be asked to do is choose an application name. This can be a high level description of the product you're trying to build. An example might be an application named \"chat\" which has two services \"frontend\" and \"api\" . These two services could then be deployed to a \"test\" and \"production\" environment. Environments Rumor has it, there are people out there that can write perfect code on the first go without any bugs. While we tip our hats to those folks, we believe it's important to be able to test new code on a non-customer facing version of your service before promoting to production. In Copilot we do this by using environments . Each environment can have its own version of a service running allowing you to create a \"test\" and \"production\" environment. You can deploy your service to the test environment, make sure everything looks good, then deploy to your production environment. Since each environment is independent, if you deploy a bug to your test environment, customers using a service deployed to your production environment will be fine. Until now we've been talking about just one service, but what happens when you want to add another service? Perhaps you want to add a backend service to complement your frontend service. Each environment contains a set of resources shared between all the deployed services - these resources include the network (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, etc...), the ECS Cluster, and the load balancer. If you deploy both your frontend and backend service to your test environment, both services will share the same network and cluster. Services A service is your code and all of the supporting infrastructure needed to get it up and running on AWS. When you first get started setting up a service, Copilot will ask you what type of service you want to create. The type of service determines the infrastructure that'll be created to support your code. If you want your code to serve traffic from the internet, for example, Copilot can set up an Application Load Balancer and an Amazon ECS Service running on AWS Fargate. Once you've told Copilot what type of service you're building, Copilot will take care of building your code's Dockerfile and storing the images securely in an Amazon ECR repository. Copilot will also create a simple file called the manifest which contains all the knobs and toggles for your service. This includes things like how much memory and CPU should be allocated to each copy of your service, how many copies of your service you want running, and more. Jobs Jobs are ephemeral Amazon ECS tasks that are triggered by an event. Once their work is done, the task terminates. Just like services, Copilot will ask you all the necessary information to quickly get going with a scheduled task on AWS. The manifest file can always be used to adjust the configuration and provide more advanced settings. Pipelines Now that you've got an application with a few services deployed to a couple of environments, staying on top of those deployments can become tricky. Copilot can help by setting up a release pipeline that deploys your service whenever you push to your git repository. (At this time, Copilot supports GitHub, Bitbucket, and CodeCommit repositories.) When a push is detected, your pipeline will build your service, push the image to ECR, and deploy to your environments.

In this section, we'll talk about using Copilot to set up a CodePipeline that automatically builds your service code when you push to your GitHub, Bitbucket or AWS CodeCommit repository, deploys to your environments, and runs automated testing. Why? We won't get too philosophical about releasing software, but what's the point of having a release pipeline? With copilot deploy you can deploy your service directly from your computer to ECS, so why add a middleman? That's a great question. For some apps, manually using deploy is enough, but as your release process gets more complicated (as you add more environments or add automated testing, for example) you want to offload the boring work of repeatedly orchestrating that process to a service. With two services, each having two environments (test and production, say), running integration tests after you deploy to your test environment becomes surprisingly cumbersome to do by hand. Using an automated release tool like CodePipeline helps make your release manageable. Even if your release isn't particularly complicated, knowing that you can just git push to deploy your change always feels a little magical \ud83c\udf08. Pipeline structure Copilot can set up a CodePipeline for you with a few commands - but before we jump into that, let's talk a little bit about the structure of the pipeline we'll be generating. Our pipeline will have the following basic structure: Source Stage - when you push to a configured GitHub, Bitbucket, or CodeCommit repository branch, a new pipeline execution is triggered. Build Stage - after your source code is pulled from your repository host, your service's container image is built and published to every environment's ECR repository. Deploy Stages - after your code is built, you can deploy to any or all of your environments, with optional post-deployment tests or manual approvals. Once you've set up a CodePipeline using Copilot, all you'll have to do is push to your GitHub, Bitbucket, or CodeCommit repository, and CodePipeline will orchestrate the deployments. Want to learn more about CodePipeline? Check out their getting started docs . Creating a Pipeline in 3 steps Creating a Pipeline requires only three steps: Preparing the pipeline structure. Committing and pushing the files generated in the copilot/ directory. Creating the actual CodePipeline. Follow the three steps below, from your workspace root: $ copilot pipeline init $ git add copilot/pipeline.yml copilot/buildspec.yml copilot/.workspace && git commit -m \"Adding pipeline artifacts\" && git push $ copilot pipeline update \u2728 And you'll have a new pipeline configured in your application account. Want to understand a little bit more what's going on? Read on! Setting up a Pipeline, step by step Step 1: Configuring your Pipeline Pipeline configurations are created at a workspace level. If your workspace has a single service, then your pipeline will be triggered only for that service. However, if you have multiple services in a workspace, then the pipeline will build all the services in the workspace. To start setting up a pipeline, cd into your service(s)'s workspace and run: copilot pipeline init This won't create your pipeline, but it will create some local files that will be used when creating your pipeline. Release order : You'll be prompted for environments you want to deploy to - select them based on the order you want them to be deployed in your pipeline (deployments happen one environment at a time). You may, for example, want to deploy to your test environment first, and then your prod environment. Tracking repository : After you've selected the environments you want to deploy to, you'll be prompted to select which repository you want your CodePipeline to track. This is the repository that, when pushed to, will trigger a pipeline execution. (If the repository you're interested in doesn't show up, you can pass it in using the --url flag.) Personal access token : If you have selected a GitHub repository, you'll need to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token in order for CodePipeline to track that repository. You can read how to do that here . Your token needs to have repo and admin:repo_hook permissions (so CodePipeline can create a webHook on your behalf). Your GitHub Personal Access Token is stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager . Step 2: Updating the Pipeline manifest (optional) Just like your service has a simple manifest file, so does your pipeline. After you run pipeline init , two files are created: pipeline.yml and buildspec.yml , both in your copilot/ directory. If you poke in, you'll see that the pipeline.yml looks something like this (for a service called \"api-frontend\" with two environments, \"test\" and \"prod\"): # This YAML file defines the relationship and deployment ordering of your environments. # The name of the pipeline name : pipeline-ecs-kudos-kohidave-demo-api-frontend # The version of the schema used in this template version : 1 # This section defines the source artifacts. source : # The name of the provider that is used to store the source artifacts. provider : GitHub # Additional properties that further specifies the exact location # the artifacts should be sourced from. For example, the GitHub provider # has the following properties: repository, branch. properties : access_token_secret : github-token-ecs-kudos-demo-api-frontend branch : main repository : https://github.com/kohidave/demo-api-frontend # The deployment section defines the order the pipeline will deploy # to your environments. stages : - # The name of the environment to deploy to. name : test test_commands : - make test - echo \"woo! Tests passed\" - # The name of the environment to deploy to. name : prod # requires_approval: true There are 3 main parts of this file: the name field, which is the name of your CodePipeline, the source section, which details the repository and branch to track, and the stages section, which lists the environments you want this pipeline to deploy to. You can update this anytime, but you must run copilot pipeline update afterwards. Typically, you'll update this file if you add new environments you want to deploy to, or want to track a different branch. The pipeline manifest is also where you may add a manual approval step before deployment or commands to run tests (see \"Adding Tests,\" below) after deployment. Step 3: Updating the Buildspec (optional) Along with pipeline.yml , the pipeline init command also generated a buildspec.yml file in the copilot/ directory. This contains the instructions for building and publishing your service. If you want to run any additional commands, besides docker build , such as unit tests or style checkers, feel free to add them to the buildspec's build phase. When this buildspec runs, it pulls down the version of Copilot which was used when you ran pipeline init , to ensure backwards compatibility. Step 4: Pushing New Files to your Repository Now that your pipeline.yml , buildspec.yml , and .workspace files have been created, add them to your repository. These files in your copilot/ directory are required for your pipeline's build stage to run successfully. Step 5: Creating your Pipeline Here's the fun part! Run: copilot pipeline update This parses your pipeline.yml , creates a CodePipeline in the same account and region as your project and kicks off a pipeline execution. Log into the AWS Console to watch your pipeline go, or run copilot pipeline status to check in on its execution. Adding Tests Of course, one of the most important parts of a pipeline is the automated testing. To add tests, such as integration or end-to-end tests, that run after a deployment stage, include those commands in the test_commands section. If all the tests succeed, your change is promoted to the next stage. Adding test_commands generates a CodeBuild project with the aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:3.0 image - so most commands from Amazon Linux 2 (including make ) are available for use. In the example below, the pipeline will run the make test command (in your source code directory) and only promote the change to the prod stage if that command exits successfully. name : pipeline-ecs-kudos-kohidave-demo-api-frontend version : 1 source : provider : GitHub properties : access_token_secret : github-token-ecs-kudos-demo-api-frontend branch : main repository : https://github.com/kohidave/demo-api-frontend stages : - name : test # A change will only deploy to the production stage if the # make test and echo commands exit successfully. test_commands : - make test - echo \"woo!

However, if you have multiple services in a workspace, then the pipeline will build all the services in the workspace. To start setting up a pipeline, cd into your service(s)'s workspace and run: copilot pipeline init This won't create your pipeline, but it will create some local files that will be used when creating your pipeline. Release order : You'll be prompted for environments you want to deploy to - select them based on the order you want them to be deployed in your pipeline (deployments happen one environment at a time). You may, for example, want to deploy to your test environment first, and then your prod environment. Tracking repository : After you've selected the environments you want to deploy to, you'll be prompted to select which repository you want your CodePipeline to track. This is the repository that, when pushed to, will trigger a pipeline execution. (If the repository you're interested in doesn't show up, you can pass it in using the --url flag.) Personal access token : If you have selected a GitHub repository, you'll need to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token in order for CodePipeline to track that repository. You can read how to do that here . Your token needs to have repo and admin:repo_hook permissions (so CodePipeline can create a webHook on your behalf). Your GitHub Personal Access Token is stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager .","title":"Step 1: Configuring your Pipeline"},{"location":"docs/concepts/pipelines/#step-2-updating-the-pipeline-manifest-optional","text":"Just like your service has a simple manifest file, so does your pipeline. After you run pipeline init , two files are created: pipeline.yml and buildspec.yml , both in your copilot/ directory. If you poke in, you'll see that the pipeline.yml looks something like this (for a service called \"api-frontend\" with two environments, \"test\" and \"prod\"): # This YAML file defines the relationship and deployment ordering of your environments. # The name of the pipeline name : pipeline-ecs-kudos-kohidave-demo-api-frontend # The version of the schema used in this template version : 1 # This section defines the source artifacts. source : # The name of the provider that is used to store the source artifacts. provider : GitHub # Additional properties that further specifies the exact location # the artifacts should be sourced from. For example, the GitHub provider # has the following properties: repository, branch. properties : access_token_secret : github-token-ecs-kudos-demo-api-frontend branch : main repository : https://github.com/kohidave/demo-api-frontend # The deployment section defines the order the pipeline will deploy # to your environments. stages : - # The name of the environment to deploy to. name : test test_commands : - make test - echo \"woo! Tests passed\" - # The name of the environment to deploy to. name : prod # requires_approval: true There are 3 main parts of this file: the name field, which is the name of your CodePipeline, the source section, which details the repository and branch to track, and the stages section, which lists the environments you want this pipeline to deploy to. You can update this anytime, but you must run copilot pipeline update afterwards. Typically, you'll update this file if you add new environments you want to deploy to, or want to track a different branch. The pipeline manifest is also where you may add a manual approval step before deployment or commands to run tests (see \"Adding Tests,\" below) after deployment.","title":"Step 2: Updating the Pipeline manifest (optional)"},{"location":"docs/concepts/pipelines/#step-3-updating-the-buildspec-optional","text":"Along with pipeline.yml , the pipeline init command also generated a buildspec.yml file in the copilot/ directory. This contains the instructions for building and publishing your service. If you want to run any additional commands, besides docker build , such as unit tests or style checkers, feel free to add them to the buildspec's build phase. When this buildspec runs, it pulls down the version of Copilot which was used when you ran pipeline init , to ensure backwards compatibility.","title":"Step 3: Updating the Buildspec (optional)"},{"location":"docs/concepts/pipelines/#step-4-pushing-new-files-to-your-repository","text":"Now that your pipeline.yml , buildspec.yml , and .workspace files have been created, add them to your repository.

To add tests, such as integration or end-to-end tests, that run after a deployment stage, include those commands in the test_commands section. If all the tests succeed, your change is promoted to the next stage. Adding test_commands generates a CodeBuild project with the aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:3.0 image - so most commands from Amazon Linux 2 (including make ) are available for use. In the example below, the pipeline will run the make test command (in your source code directory) and only promote the change to the prod stage if that command exits successfully. name : pipeline-ecs-kudos-kohidave-demo-api-frontend version : 1 source : provider : GitHub properties : access_token_secret : github-token-ecs-kudos-demo-api-frontend branch : main repository : https://github.com/kohidave/demo-api-frontend stages : - name : test # A change will only deploy to the production stage if the # make test and echo commands exit successfully. test_commands : - make test - echo \"woo!

Copilot makes running those same containers on AWS as easy as typing copilot init . Copilot will build your image, push it to Amazon ECR and set up all the infrastructure to run your service in a scalable and secure way. Creating a Service Creating a service to run your containers on AWS can be done in a few ways. The easiest way is by running the init command from the same directory as your Dockerfile. $ copilot init You'll be asked which application you want this service to be a part of (or asked to create an application if there isn't one). Copilot will then ask about the type of service you're trying to build. After selecting a service type, Copilot will detect any health checks or exposed ports from your Dockerfile and ask if you'd like to deploy. Choosing a Service Type We mentioned before that Copilot will set up all the infrastructure your service needs to run. But how does it know what kind of infrastructure to use? When you're setting up a service, Copilot will ask you about what kind of service you want to build. Load Balanced Web Service Do you want your service to serve internet traffic? You can select a Load Balanced Web Service and Copilot will provision an application load balancer, security groups, an ECS Service and run your service on Fargate. Backend Service If you want a service that can't be accessed externally, but only from other services within your application, you can create a Backend Service . Copilot will provision an ECS Service running on AWS Fargate, but won't set up any internet-facing endpoints. Config and the Manifest After you've run copilot init you might have noticed that Copilot created a file called manifest.yml in the copilot directory. This manifest file contains common configuration options for your service. While the exact set of options depends on the type of service you're running, common ones include the resources allocated to your service (like memory and CPU), health checks, and environment variables. Let's take a look at the manifest for a Load Balanced Web Service called front-end . name : front-end type : Load Balanced Web Service image : # Path to your service's Dockerfile. build : ./Dockerfile # Port exposed through your container to route traffic to it. port : 8080 http : # Requests to this path will be forwarded to your service. # To match all requests you can use the \"/\" path. path : '/' # You can specify a custom health check path. The default is \"/\" # healthcheck: '/' # Number of CPU units for the task. cpu : 256 # Amount of memory in MiB used by the task. memory : 512 # Number of tasks that should be running in your service. count : 1 # Optional fields for more advanced use-cases. # variables : # Pass environment variables as key value pairs. LOG_LEVEL : info #secrets: # Pass secrets from AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store. # GITHUB_TOKEN: GH_SECRET_TOKEN # The key is the name of the environment variable, # the value is the name of the SSM parameter. # You can override any of the values defined above by environment. environments : prod : count : 2 # Number of tasks to run for the \"prod\" environment. To learn about the specification of manifest files, see the manifest page. Deploying a Service Once you've set up your service, you can deploy it (and any changes to your manifest) by running the deploy command: $ copilot deploy Running this command will: Build your image locally Push to your service's ECR repository Convert your manifest file to CloudFormation Package any additional infrastructure into CloudFormation Deploy your updated service and resources to CloudFormation If you have multiple environments, you'll be prompted to select which environment you want to deploy to. Digging into your Service Now that we've got a service up and running, we can check on it using Copilot. Below are a few common ways to check in on your deployed service. What's in your service? Running copilot svc show will show you a summary of your service. Here's an example of the output you might see for a load balanced web application. This output includes the configuration of your service for each environment, all the endpoints for your service, and the environment variables passed into your service. You can also provide an optional --resources flag to see all AWS resources associated with your service. $ copilot svc show About Application my-app Name front-end Type Load Balanced Web Service Configurations Environment Tasks CPU ( vCPU ) Memory ( MiB ) Port test 1 0 .25 512 80 Routes Environment URL test http://my-ap-Publi-1RV8QEBNTEQCW-1762184596.ca-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com Service Discovery Environment Namespace test front-end.my-app.local:8080 Variables Name Environment Value COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME test my-app COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME test test COPILOT_LB_DNS test my-ap-Publi-1RV8QEBNTEQCW-1762184596.ca-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com COPILOT_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT test my-app.local COPILOT_SERVICE_NAME test front-end What's your service status? Often it's handy to be able to check on the status of your service. Are all the instances of my service healthy? Are there any alarms firing? To do that, you can run copilot svc status to get a summary of your service's status. $ copilot svc status Service Status ACTIVE 1 / 1 running tasks ( 0 pending ) Last Deployment Updated At 12 minutes ago Task Definition arn:aws:ecs:ca-central-1:693652174720:task-definition/my-app-test-front-end:1 Task Status ID Image Digest Last Status Health Status Started At Stopped At 37236ed3 da3cfcdd RUNNING HEALTHY 12 minutes ago - Alarms Name Health Last Updated Reason CPU-Utilization OK 5 minutes ago - Where are my service logs?

For example, an addon can be a DynamoDB table or S3 bucket that your service needs to read or write to. How do I add an S3 bucket or DDB Table? Copilot provides the following commands to help you create certain kinds of addons: storage init will create a DynamoDB table or S3 bucket. You can run copilot storage init from your workspace and be guided through some questions to help you set up these resources. How to do I add other resources? For other types of addons, you can add your own custom CloudFormation templates according to the following instructions. Let's say you have a service named webhook in your workspace: . \u2514\u2500\u2500 copilot \u2514\u2500\u2500 webhook \u2514\u2500\u2500 manifest.yml And you want to add a custom DynamoDB table to webhook .

For example, if we want to also add an S3 bucket addon to our service then we could either run storage init or create our own custom, separate mybucket-s3.yaml file. When your service gets deployed, Copilot merges all these files into a single AWS CloudFormation template and creates a nested stack under your service's stack. What does an addon template look like? An addon template can be any valid CloudFormation template. However, by default, Copilot will pass the App , Env , and Name Parameters ; you can customize your resource properties with Conditions or Mappings if you wish to. If you need to access your Resources from your ECS task, make sure to: Define an IAM ManagedPolicy resource in your template that holds the permissions for your task and add an Output so that the permission is injected to your ECS Task Role. Create an Output for any value that you want to be injected as an environment variable to your ECS tasks. Here is an example template layout for a DynamoDB table addon: # You can use any of these parameters to create conditions or mappings in your template. Parameters : App : Type : String Description : Your application's name. Env : Type : String Description : The environment name your service, job, or workflow is being deployed to.

Your service can reference them without having to define them. Environment variables are useful for when you want to pass in data to your service that's specific to a particular environment. For example, your test database name versus your production database name. Accessing environment variables is usually simply based on the language you're using. Here are some examples of getting an environment variable called DATABASE_NAME in a few different languages. Go dbName := os . Getenv ( \"DATABASE_NAME\" ) Javascript var dbName = process . env . DATABASE_NAME ; Python database_name = os . getenv ( 'DATABASE_NAME' ) What are the Default Environment Variables? By default, the AWS Copilot CLI passes in some default environment variables for your service to use. COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME - this is the name of the application this service is running in. COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME - this is the name of the environment the service is running in (test vs prod, for example) COPILOT_SERVICE_NAME - this is the name of the current service. COPILOT_LB_DNS - this is the DNS name of the Load Balancer (if it exists) such as kudos-Publi-MC2WNHAIOAVS-588300247.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com . Note: if you're using a custom domain name, this value will still be the Load Balancer's DNS name. COPILOT_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT - this is the endpoint to add after a service name to talk to another service in your environment via service discovery. The value is {app name}.local . For more information about service discovery, check out our Service Discovery guide . How do I add my own Environment Variables? Adding your own environment variable is easy. You can add them directly to your manifest in the variables section. The following snippet will pass a environment variable called LOG_LEVEL to your service, with the value set to debug . # in copilot/{service name}/manifest.yml variables : LOG_LEVEL : debug You can also pass in a specific value for an environment variable based on the environment. We'll follow the same example as above, by setting the log level, but overriding the value to be info in our production environment.

Typically, services can only talk to each other if they expose a public endpoint - and even then, requests will have to go over the internet.

Its partition key will be id , a Number attribute; its sort key will be email , a String attribute; and it will have a local secondary index (essentially an alternate sort key) on the Number attribute post-count . File Systems Mounting an EFS volume in Copilot tasks requires two things: That you create an EFS file system in the desired environment's region. That you create an EFS Mount Target using the Copilot environment security group in each subnet of your environment. When those prerequisites are satisfied, you can enable EFS storage using simple syntax in your manifest. You'll need the filesystem ID and, if using, the access point configuration for the filesystem. Info You can only use a given EFS file system in a single environment at a time. Mount targets are limited to one per availability zone; therefore, you must delete any existing mount targets before bringing the file system to Copilot if you have used it in another VPC. Manifest Syntax The simplest possible EFS volume can be specified with the following syntax: storage : volumes : myEFSVolume : # This is a variable key and can be set to an arbitrary string. path : '/etc/mount1' efs : id : fs-1234567 This will create a read-only mounted volume in your service's or job's container using the filesystem fs-1234567 . If mount targets are not created in the subnets of the environment, the task will fail to launch. Full syntax for storage follows. storage : volumes : {{ volume name }}: path : {{ mount path }} # Required. The path inside the container. read_only : {{ boolean }} # Default: true efs : id : {{ filesystem ID }} # Required. root_dir : {{ filesystem root }} # Optional. Defaults to \"/\". Must not be # specified if using access points. auth : iam : {{ boolean }} # Optional. Whether to use IAM authorization when # mounting this filesystem. access_point_id : {{ access point ID }} # Optional. The ID of the EFS Access Point # to use when mounting this filesystem. Creating Mount Targets There are several ways to create mount targets for an existing EFS filesystem: using the AWS CLI and using CloudFormation . With the AWS CLI To create mount targets for an existing filesystem, you'll need the ID of that filesystem. a Copilot environment deployed in the same account and region. To retrieve the filesystem ID, you can use the AWS CLI: $ EFS_FILESYSTEMS = $( aws efs describe-file-systems | \\ jq '.FileSystems[] | {ID: .FileSystemId, CreationTime: .CreationTime, Size: .SizeInBytes.Value}' ) If you echo this variable you should be able to find which filesystem you need. Assign it to the variable $EFS_ID and continue. You'll also need the public subnets of the Copilot environment and the Environment Security Group. This jq command will filter the output of the describe-stacks call down to simply the desired output value. Info The filesystem you use MUST be in the same region as your Copilot environment! $ SUBNETS = $( aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ${ YOUR_APP } - ${ YOUR_ENV } \\ | jq '.Stacks[] | .Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey == \"PublicSubnets\") | .OutputValue' ) $ SUBNET1 = $( echo $SUBNETS | jq -r 'split(\",\") | .[0]' ) $ SUBNET2 = $( echo $SUBNETS | jq -r 'split(\",\") | .[1]' ) $ ENV_SG = $( aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ${ YOUR_APP } - ${ YOUR_ENV } \\ | jq -r '.Stacks[] | .Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey == \"EnvironmentSecurityGroup\") | .OutputValue' ) Once you have these, create the mount targets. $ MOUNT_TARGET_1_ID = $( aws efs create-mount-target \\ --subnet-id $SUBNET_1 \\ --security-groups $ENV_SG \\ --file-system-id $EFS_ID | jq -r .MountTargetID ) $ MOUNT_TARGET_2_ID = $( aws efs create-mount-target \\ --subnet-id $SUBNET_2 \\ --security-groups $ENV_SG \\ --file-system-id $EFS_ID | jq -r .MountTargetID ) Once you've done this, you can specify the storage configuration in the manifest as above. Cleanup Delete the mount targets using the AWS CLI. $ aws efs delete-mount-target --mount-target-id $MOUNT_TARGET_1 $ aws efs delete-mount-target --mount-target-id $MOUNT_TARGET_2 CloudFormation Here's an example of how you might create the appropriate EFS infrastructure for an external file system using a CloudFormation stack. After creating an environment, deploy the following CloudFormation template into the same account and region as the environment. Place the following CloudFormation template into a file called efs.yml . Parameters : App : Type : String Description : Your application's name. Env : Type : String Description : The environment name your service, job, or workflow is being deployed to.

To get the EFS filesystem ID, you can run a describe-stacks call: $ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name efs-cfn | \\ jq -r '.Stacks[] | .Outputs[] | .OutputValue' Then, in the manifest of the service which you would like to have access to the EFS filesystem, add the following configuration. storage : volumes : copilotVolume : # This is a variable key and can be set to arbitrary strings. path : '/etc/mount1' read_only : true # Set to false if your service needs write access. efs : id : {{ your filesystem ID }} Finally, run copilot svc deploy to reconfigure your service to mount the filesystem at /etc/mount1 .

In this tutorial we\u2019re going to do just that - we\u2019re going to deploy a sample front end service that you can visit in your browser. While we\u2019ll be using a sample static website in this example, you can use AWS Copilot to build and deploy any container app with a Dockerfile. After we get your service all set up, we\u2019ll show you how to delete the resources Copilot created to avoid charges. Sound fun? Let\u2019s do it! Step 1: Download & Configure AWS Copilot You\u2019ll need a few things to use AWS Copilot - the AWS Copilot binary, AWS CLI, Docker Desktop and AWS credentials. Follow our instructions here on how to set up and configure all these tools. Make sure that you have a default profile! Run aws configure to set one up! Step 2: Download some code to deploy In this example, we\u2019ll be using a sample app that\u2019s just a simple static website - but if you already have something you\u2019d like to deploy, just open your terminal and cd into your Dockerfile\u2019s directory. Otherwise you can just clone our sample repository. In your terminal, copy and paste this code. This will clone our sample app and change directories to it. $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-copilot-sample-service example $ cd example Step 3: Set up our app Now this is where the fun starts! We have our service code and our Dockerfile and we want to get it deployed to AWS. Let\u2019s have AWS Copilot help us do just that! From within your code directory run: $ copilot init Step 4: Answer a few questions The next thing we\u2019re going to do is answer a few questions from Copilot. Copilot will use these questions to help us choose the best AWS infrastructure for your service. There\u2019s only a few so let\u2019s go through them: \u201cWhat would you like to name your application\u201d - an application is a collection of services. In this example we\u2019ll only have one service in our app, but if you wanted to have a multi-service app, Copilot makes that easy. Let\u2019s call this app example-app . \u201cWhich service type best represents your service's architecture?\u201d - Copilot is asking us what we want our service to do - do we want it to service traffic? Do we want it to be a private backend service? For us, we want our app to be accessible from the web, so let's hit enter and select Load Balanced Web Service . \u201cWhat do you want to name this Load Balanced Web Service?\u201d - now what should we call our service in our app? Be as creative as you want - but I recommend naming this service front-end . \u201cWhich Dockerfile would you like to use for front-end?\u201d - go ahead and choose the default Dockerfile here. This is the service that Copilot will build and deploy for you. Once you choose your Dockerfile, Copilot will start setting up the AWS infrastructure to manage your service. Step 5: Deploy your service Once Copilot finishes setting up the infrastructure to manage your app, you\u2019ll be asked if you want to deploy your service to a test environment type yes. Now we can wait a few minutes \u23f3 while Copilot sets up all the resources needed to run your service. After all the infrastructure for your service is set up, Copilot will build your image and push it to Amazon ECR, and start deploying to Amazon ECS. After your deployment completes your service will be up and running on AWS Fargate and Copilot will print a link to the URL \ud83c\udf89! Step 6: Clean up Now that you've deployed your service, let's go ahead and run copilot app delete - this will delete all the resources Copilot set up for your application, including your ECS Service and the ECR Repository. To delete everything run: $ copilot app delete Congratulations! Congratulations! You have learned how to set up, deploy, and delete your container application to Amazon ECS using AWS Copilot. AWS Copilot is a command line tool that helps you develop, release and operate your container apps on AWS.

Supported rates: \"@yearly\" \"@monthly\" \"@weekly\" \"@daily\" \"@hourly\" \"@every {duration}\" (For example, \"1m\", \"5m\") \"rate({duration})\" based on CloudWatch's rate expressions Alternatively, you can specify a cron schedule if you'd like to trigger the job at a specific time: \"* * * * *\" based on the standard cron format . \"cron({fields})\" based on CloudWatch's cron expressions with six fields. image Map The image section contains parameters relating to the Docker build configuration. image. build String or Map If you specify a string, Copilot interprets it as the path to your Dockerfile. It will assume that the dirname of the string you specify should be the build context. The manifest: image : build : path/to/dockerfile will result in the following call to docker build: $ docker build --file path/to/dockerfile path/to You can also specify build as a map: image : build : dockerfile : path/to/dockerfile context : context/dir target : build-stage cache_from : - image:tag args : key : value In this case, Copilot will use the context directory you specified and convert the key-value pairs under args to --build-arg overrides. The equivalent docker build call will be: $ docker build --file path/to/dockerfile --target build-stage --cache-from image:tag --build-arg key=value context/dir . You can omit fields and Copilot will do its best to understand what you mean. For example, if you specify context but not dockerfile , Copilot will run Docker in the context directory and assume that your Dockerfile is named \"Dockerfile.\" If you specify dockerfile but no context , Copilot assumes you want to run Docker in the directory that contains dockerfile . All paths are relative to your workspace root. image. location String Instead of building a container from a Dockerfile, you can specify an existing image name. Mutually exclusive with image.build . The location field follows the same definition as the image parameter in the Amazon ECS task definition. cpu Integer Number of CPU units for the task. See the Amazon ECS docs for valid CPU values. memory Integer Amount of memory in MiB used by the task. See the Amazon ECS docs for valid memory values. retries Integer The number of times to retry the job before failing. timeout Duration How long the job should run before it aborts and fails. You can use the units: h , m , or s . network Map The network section contains parameters for connecting to AWS resources in a VPC. network. vpc Map Subnets and security groups attached to your tasks. network.vpc. placement String Must be one of 'public' or 'private' . Defaults to launching your tasks in public subnets. Info Launching tasks in 'private' subnets that need internet connectivity is only supported if you imported a VPC with NAT Gateways when running copilot env init . See #1959 for tracking NAT Gateways support in Copilot-generated VPCs. network.vpc. security_groups Array of Strings Additional security group IDs associated with your tasks. Copilot always includes a security group so containers within your environment can communicate with each other. variables Map Key-value pairs that represent environment variables that will be passed to your job. Copilot will include a number of environment variables by default for you. secrets Map Key-value pairs that represent secret values from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store that will be securely passed to your job as environment variables. storage Map The Storage section lets you specify external EFS volumes for your containers and sidecars to mount. This allows you to access persistent storage across regions for data processing or CMS workloads. For more detail, see the storage page. storage. volumes Map Specify the name and configuration of any EFS volumes you would like to attach. The volumes field is specified as a map of the form: volumes : {{ volume name }}: path : \"/etc/mountpath\" efs : ... storage.volumes. volume Map Specify the configuration of a volume. volume. path String Required. Specify the location in the container where you would like your volume to be mounted. Must be fewer than 242 characters and must consist only of the characters a-zA-Z0-9.-_/ . volume. read_only Bool Optional. Defaults to true . Defines whether the volume is read-only or not. If false, the container is granted elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite permissions to the filesystem and the volume is writable. volume. efs Map Specify more detailed EFS configuration. volume.efs. id String Required. The ID of the filesystem you would like to mount. volume.efs. root_dir String Optional. Defaults to / . Specify the location in the EFS filesystem you would like to use as the root of your volume. Must be fewer than 255 characters and must consist only of the characters a-zA-Z0-9.-_/ . If using an access point, root_dir must be either empty or / and auth.iam must be true . volume.efs. auth Map Specify advanced authorization configuration for EFS. volume.efs.auth. iam Bool Optional. Defaults to true . Whether or not to use IAM authorization to determine whether the volume is allowed to connect to EFS. volume.efs.auth. access_point_id String Optional. Defaults to \"\" . The ID of the EFS access point to connect to. If using an access point, root_dir must be either empty or / and auth.iam must be true . environments Map The environment section lets you override any value in your manifest based on the environment you're in. In the example manifest above, we're overriding the CPU parameter so that our production container is more performant.","title":"Scheduled Job"}]}
